# 👋 Hello, I'm Gustav

I'm a Software Developer with a passion for **macOS** and **iOS app development**, with several apps launched on the App Store. I first explored programming through **game development**, where I’ve released numerous games on [illusionarygames.com](https://illusionarygames.com) and still do. However, building apps and working on other software and tools is where I found my true passion.

While **app development** remains my core expertise, I still dive into **game development** when inspiration strikes. My work is driven by a strong desire to always make the best possible product, focusing on simplicity, performance, and the small details that make a big difference to users.

> "Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning." ― Rick Cook
